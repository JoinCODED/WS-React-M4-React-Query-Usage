### Using Formik

To use Formik, you will need to import it into your React component:

```js
import { Formik } from "formik";
```

You can then use the Formik component to wrap your form elements:

```js
<Formik
  initialValues={{ email: "", password: "" }}
  onSubmit={(values) => {
    // handle form submission
  }}
>
  <Form>
    <input
      type="email"
      name="email"
      onChange={props.handleChange}
      onBlur={props.handleBlur}
      value={props.values.email}
    />
    <input
      type="password"
      name="password"
      onChange={props.handleChange}
      onBlur={props.handleBlur}
      value={props.values.password}
    />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </Form>
</Formik>
```
In the above example, initialValues defines the initial state of the form, onSubmit defines the function to handle form submission, and props contains various properties and functions provided by Formik that can be used to handle form input and validation.
